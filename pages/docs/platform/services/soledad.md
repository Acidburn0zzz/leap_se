Topology
--------------------

Currently, the platform is designed for `soledad` and `couchdb` services to be combined (e.g. every `soledad` node should also be a `couchdb` node). `soledad` nodes might work in isolation, but this is not tested.

Configuration
------------------------

There are no options to configure for `soledad` nodes.
