I am pleased to announce that we will be working on adding LEAP support to
[[TorBirdy => https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy]], the
extension for Mozilla Thunderbird that configures it to make connections over
the Tor network and enhances Thunderbird's security and privacy settings. Over
the next few months -- thanks to a grant funded by [[NLnet =>
https://www.nlnet.nl/]] -- we will work on making general improvements to
TorBirdy, and on integrating LEAP support using the Bitmask WebSockets API.
Please subscribe to the [[leap-discuss mailing list =>
https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/leap-discuss]] to keep track of the
development!
