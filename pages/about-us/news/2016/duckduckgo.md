Honestly, I have always been a shill for DuckDuckGo, the search engine that doesn't track its users. If you haven't tried DuckDuckGo recently, you really should. It keeps getting better all the time, largely thanks to an [[army of volunteer hackers => https://duck.co/]] who keep adding nice instant answers for all sort of useful things. DuckDuckGo also gives tons of money to great free software and security projects, and this year [[LEAP was included => https://duck.co/blog/post/303/2016-foss-donations-announcement]]. So, the next time I bump into you at the caf√©, I better see DuckDuckGo as your default search engine or I am throwing your laptop into the street.
