Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015 is over. It was a success and we're very happy about the new LEAP webapp features that just got merged! We had two teams this year working on two major feature for the [LEAP webapp](https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/services/webapp). The webapp is using ruby on rails, so we applied with it to this years RGSOC as an organisation.

# Bitcoin Payments

The [team from Quito, Ecuador](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/90) worked on implementing the [billing engine](https://github.com/leapcode/leap_web/tree/develop/engines/billing) which allows the provider to bill its customers for their plans. Currently, [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) is the only payment provider which customers can use with Pay Pal, Bitcoin and Credit Cards.

# Invite Codes

Our [team in Hamburg, Germany](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/52) implemented the [invite code](https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/services/webapp#invite-codes) feature. Admins can generate invite codes so they can limit the registration, which before was either closed or completely open.


# Thank you !

A big thanks goes to all people that helped making this years Summer of Code such a success, including the orga team, coaches, mentors and most of all, to both of the amazing teams that did the actual code !
We hope we can participate again in next years Summer of Code again.
