Bitmask for Android 0.9.3 has been released. This release includes important bugfixes and now, when the VPN fails to establish, your connection isn't blocked. On top of that we improved the ability to switch seemlessly between providers. The experience now is simple, clear, and smooth like butter.

Bitmask Android is currently in maintenance mode, but we've been able to sneak in a feature here and there. The most visible one is the separation of the user status feedback from the VPN information. Now you can find your status at the top of the screen, allowing VPN to reflect its status accurately even when you change the screen orientation of your device.
