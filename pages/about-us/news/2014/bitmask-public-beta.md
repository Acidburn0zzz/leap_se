Bitmask Public Beta
-------------------------------------------

The LEAP Encryption Access Project (LEAP) is launching the first public beta of the Bitmask application for Linux and Android.

*Bitmask* is an open source application to provide easy and secure encrypted communication. You can choose among several different service providers or start your own. Bitmask supports VPN with Encrypted Email coming soon.

The *Bitmask* application is designed to have a *friendly* interface with *automatic* configuration. You simply start the application, register with the compatible service provider of your choice, and away you go.

With Bitmask VPN, all your traffic is securely routed through your provider before it is decrypted and sent on to the open internet.

* *Thwart Network Surveillance*: Bitmask VPN is very effective at bypassing most censorship and network surveillance by your ISP or country.

* *Anonymize your address*: Your IP address will also be hidden, keeping your physical location safe from nefarious websites or network eavesdroppers.

* *Extra Security*: We take extra security measures to prevent problems common to other personal VPNs, such as DNS leakage and IPv6 leakage (not all enhancements available on Android).

To install Bitmask, visit https://bitmask.net

Currently, the only language that is supported in the application and help documentation is English. We are adding more languages soon.

Users: Let us know what you think by sending a message to discuss@leap.se or on irc.freenode.net #leap. If you have any problems, bug reports can be filed here and are super appreciated! https://leap.se/code

Providers: If you are interested in providing Bitmask-compatible services, we are always available to help with your setup and launch. https://leap.se/en/docs/platform

In the coming weeks we will be fixing all the bugs you report. We are actively working on Mac (soon) and Windows (later) support, and adding auto-failover to next available gateway, autostart, and obfsproxy technology. The rest of our attention is focused on secure end to end client encrypted email. We are tantalizingly close to having a public Beta of our email service.

Stay tuned. Sign up to our mailing list (discuss-subscribe@leap.se), or follow us on twitter (@leapcode).
