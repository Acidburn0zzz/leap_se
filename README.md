LEAP Web Pages
==================================

This is the repository for the LEAP website at https://leap.se.

It is entirely static, but relies on a bunch of apache tricks for things like
language negotiation. A static website generator called `amber` is used to
render the source files into html files.

To submit changes, please fork this repo and issue pull requests on github.

For more information how to use `amber`, see: https://github.com/leapcode/amber.
